  <Move name="Zuko Style">
    <p>
      When you <strong>bend a flame to your will</strong>, roll+WIS. On a 10+ it does as you command, taking the shape

      they’ll follow you and do as you desire, so long as nothing startles or surprises them. On a 7-9, the effect is

      sparked their hidden desires.

  <Move name="From Hell’s Heart" requiresLevel="6">
    <p>
      When you <strong>summon fire</strong> with any of your moves, you can replace it with the black fires of hell
      itself. This fire does not burn with heat and ignores armor, scorching the soul itself. Those creatures without
      souls cannot be harmed by this type of flame.
    </p>
  </Move>

  <Move name="Burning Ring Of Fire" requiresLevel="6">
    <p>
      When you <strong>fuse a willing person’s soul to yours</strong>, roll+CHA. On a hit you are bound together, able
      to sense each other at any distance, as well as sharing your emotional state. On a 7-9, the connection is unstable
      and dangerous, when you take a debility, so do they (and vice versa). On a miss, the branding is rejected and you
      both erase any Bonds you have to each other. You may write new Bonds with them at the <em>End of Session</em> as
      usual. This fusion, once performed, cannot be undone by mortal means.

      village. Everyone and everything in the area takes damage as appropriate. On a 10+ you can extinguish the storm
      with a little effort. On a 7-9 the fires rage out of your control, spreading and gusting where they are carried by
      wind and weather. On a miss, something cruel, intelligent and hungry comes with the storm.
